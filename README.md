I am a mathematician from Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, and I hold a master’s degree in Actuary and Finance from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I am currently working at the Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito, where I teach Probability for the master’s program in Actuarial Sciences, as well as Integral Calculus.
